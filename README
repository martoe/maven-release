a fork of the maven-release-plugin (v2.2.2) that implements update-versions for releases (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-699)

forked from https://github.com/ge0ffrey/maven-release (originally https://github.com/apache/maven-release)

own modifications:
- release:update-versions is allowed to handle non-SNAPSHOT projects now
- release:update-versions may bump the release version to an arbitrary value (instead of just removing the SNAPSHOT suffix)
